# Global Game Jam 2022

> The GGJ mission is to empower individuals worldwide to learn, experiment, and create together through the medium of games. 

## Team
This project was completed in January 2022 during the Global Game Jam 2022 by x, y, z, and a, four students of 42Urduliz with little to no experience in game development.

## Technology
It was made with Unity, using the limited knowledge some of us already had and what we managed to learn during the jam.


## Concept
The theme chosen for the GGJ 2022 was **duality**.
Our game focuses on the split that social media create in individuals. With the excuse of bringing people together, social media push individuals to nurture another version of themselves which is not in resonance with their true self. Individuals become users who are torn between two clashing worlds. 

This is represented in our game with a game board made up of two side. The player hops from one side to the other interacting with the game. It's in the interaction between these two worlds that conflict arises.
